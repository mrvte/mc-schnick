# Minecraft Villager Schnick Schnack Schnuck
## a Spigot Server Plugin

### Vision
You can play "Schnick, Schnack, Schnuck" with a Villager to get better deals or special drop items.
If you lose you get nothing.


### Howto

Go to a villager and right-click the villager.
You'll get 1 shears, 1 stoneblock and 1 paper. Right-click the villager with the item you want to choose.

If you loose you get a stack of rotten flesh but can't trade with him
If the villager has the same item you can trade with him
If you win you'll get a stack of emeralds and the hero of the village effect for 30s.

You'll get your items back after the game.
You just can play once in one minute.

### Know issues
- cooldown works not as expected
- returning the items can cause override of the items won previously
- you can't abort the game with out loosing the items
- I don't know what happens when someone else plays the game at the same time. Maybe you get the Items of someone else xD
